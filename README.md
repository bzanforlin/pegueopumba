## The Problem
Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species causing severe environmental damage and crop losses. They form large herds and reproduce very quickly. They destroy whole crop fields, occupy the niches of native species and destroy natural river banks. Monitoring their presence is difficult because sightings are sporadic and scattered. Traditional reporting methods are slow and do not allow authorities or communities to act quickly to mitigate risks.

## Product Description
Catch the Pumba is a community-based environmental monitoring system that allows anyone to report wild boar sightings in real time via WhatsApp. Users simply send their location and, optionally, a photo of the animal. The system aggregates reports, maps them geographically, and sends alerts to registered users who have nearby areas of interest. In the future, we will create service orders to registered hunters.

## Why Our Solution Matters
Wild boars reproduce quickly and cause significant ecological and economic impacts. **In 6 years it spread its presence 4x.** Timely reporting and intervention can reduce crop destruction and natural ecosystems. Catch the Pumba turns scattered observations into actionable data, empowering citizens as environmental "watchdogs".
